# Strader
Code for IJCAI2022 paper "[A Smart Trader for Portfolio Management based on Normalizing Flows](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0557.pdf)"

Since Strader is implemented in an integrated quantitative system under development, the quantitative system cannot be open-sourced for the time being. Therefore, There is only the code of Strader's model, which can not run at present. I hope the code can help you better understand Strader's paper.  

After the quantitative system development is completed, we will provide the complete code as soon as possible. I believe this code will come out in the near future.

If you found this code useful in your research, please consider citing.
